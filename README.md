# Japanese practice tool

This is a project I made in spare time to effectively learn Japanese Kana -> Romaji conversion.

Currently, it only supports Linux builds.

Tools: Python, pip, PyQt, Makefile

To build, use ```make venv```, source the activation script and use ```make```. The output binary will be in the ```Japanese Practice``` folder.
